# Build a Nightlife Coordination App


Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.

User Story: As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.
